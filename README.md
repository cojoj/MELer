MELer
=====

**MELer** is a simple iOS application for all people interested in **aviation**.  
It doesn't matter if you're a student, aviator or retiree all that matters is the fact that you want to know
a lot about **aviation**. 

If you are a person from the description above you probably know what [MMEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_minimum_equipment_list) stands for (if not... Follow the link)!

**MELer** uses data from [this site]() and with a litte help from [MEL_Scraper]() it presents MELs in [Master-Detail](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SecondiOSAppTutorial/Introduction/Introduction.html) concept.

The idea of creating such application came from a [recruitment process](http://areusmart.pl/programista_aplikacji_mobilnych.php) for Internship in [company](http://www.smart4aviation.aero/?company.html) which is creating solutions for aviation.  
**EVERYTHING IS DONE FOR FUN AND EXPERIENCE**
