MELer
=====

**MELer** is a simple iOS application for all people interested in **aviation**.  
It doesn't matter if you're a student, aviator or retiree all that matters is the fact that you want to know
a lot about **aviation**. 

If you are a person from the description above you probably know what [MMEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_minimum_equipment_list) stands for (if not... Follow the link)!  
**Basically, MEL is list of the faulty parts of aeroplane which are not colliding with usage of this vehicle.**

**MELer** uses data from [this site](https://github.com/cojoj/MEL_Scraper) and with a litte help from [MEL_Scraper](http://www.s-techent.com/ATA100.htm) and [MELer_DB](https://github.com/cojoj/MELer_DB) it presents MEL in [Master-Detail](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SecondiOSAppTutorial/Introduction/Introduction.html) concept.

The idea of creating such application came from a [recruitment process](http://areusmart.pl/programista_aplikacji_mobilnych.php) for Internship. I've done this project with idea of getting some more experience in iOS development.
